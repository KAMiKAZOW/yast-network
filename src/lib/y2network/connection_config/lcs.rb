      # Most I/O devices on a s390 system are typically driven through the
      # channel I/O mechanism.

      # and CCW group devices, these commands use a device ID which is the
      # device bus-ID

      # The device bus-ID is of the format 0.<subchannel_set_ID>.<devno>,
      # for example, 0.0.8000.

      # a read subchannel and a write subchannel and is very similar to the
