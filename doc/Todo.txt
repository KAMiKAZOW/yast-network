ISDN:
- code cleanup (use yast2-network structure: Provider, devices, ...)
- UI cleanup (http://w3.suse.de/~sigi/yast2/modules/isdn/81isdn/isdn81_improvement_it01.html)
- isdn: start mail after config (#18256)

TO-SORT:

- all: use rcnetwork reload (but probably only in some cases, things like
  remove 2 eth cards and add them in a different order won't work due to
  the kernel modules not being unloaded)
  * "rcnetwork reload" (if DeletedModules\!=[] "restart")

- routing: summary: split gateway of the other routes
- routing: summary: print other routes in nice form
- routing: summary: print gateway hostname [Gateway: 10.20.0.1 (chimera.suse.cz)]

- dns: summary: print ns and sl in nice form
- dns: summary: print ns hostname [Name server: 10.20.0.1 (chimera.suse.cz)]
- dns: summary: differentiate between 1 and more ns
    [Name servers: 10.20.0.1 (chimera.suse.cz), 10.20.1.16 (yeti.suse.cz)]

- routines: -> FIREWALL=yes|no to each ifcfg-XXX #18840 (support for modems)

DOC:
 ESCON = Enteprise System CONnector (something like a mixture of SCSI and
         Ethernet - its a channel, but can carry network traffic)
         - short: its a point-to point network interface

 IUCV  = Inter User Communication Vehicle (means: DMA based network pipe
         between Virtual Machine instances (like vmware) on an s390)
         - short: its a point-to point network interface

DOC:
- doc: dummy: IP/NM/BC
- doc: irlan: IP/NM/BC (eth?)
- doc: irnet: IP/RI (?)
- doc: plip: IP/RI (Parallel Line IP)
- doc: slip: IP/RI (Serial Line IP, obsoleted by PPP)
- doc: ppp: IP/RI (Serial Point-To-Point protocol)

UI proposal:
- detected
- choose your card (current list)
- hw params only (current manual)

Hardware:
- usb: network cabel, ethernet card, TR card, ISDN card, modem
- pcmcia: ethernet card, TR card, ISDN card, modem
- wireless network cards
- fddi card

- make device optional in routes agent
- DefaultDevice(ip)
    check all PPP connections (REMOTEIP)
    other devices
      - take IP
      - if(network(IP) == network(ip)) return x;
- compare with old lan
- where is this used?

Modules:
