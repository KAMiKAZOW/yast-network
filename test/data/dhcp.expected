## Path:	Network/DHCP/DHCP client
## Description:	DHCPv4 client configuration variables
#
# Note: 
# To configure one or more interfaces for DHCP configuration, you have to
# change the BOOTPROTO variable in /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-<interface>
# to 'dhcp' (and possibly set STARTMODE='onboot'). 
#
# Most of the options can and should be overridden by per-interface
# settings in the ifcfg-* files.
#
# Note: NetworkManager is not using any sysconfig settings.
#

## Type:	yesno
## Default:	no
#
# Should the DHCPv4 client set the hostname? (yes|no)
# 
# When it is likely that this would occur during a running X session, 
# your DISPLAY variable could be screwed up and you won't be able to open
# new windows anymore, then this should be "no". 
#
# If it happens during booting it won't be a problem and you can 
# safely say "yes" here. For a roaming notebook with X kept running, "no"
# makes more sense. 
#
DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME="no"

## Type:	string
## Default:	AUTO
#
# Specifies the hostname option field when DHCPv4 client sends messages.
# Some DHCP servers will update nameserver entries (dynamic DNS) to it.
# Also, some DHCP servers, notably those used by @Home Networks, require
# the hostname option field containing a specific string in the DHCP
# messages from clients.
#
# When set to "AUTO", the current hostname from /etc/hostname is sent.
# Use this variable to override it with another hostname, or leave it
# empty to not send any hostname.
